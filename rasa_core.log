From /home/csk/anaconda/envs/rasa_chatbot/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/keras/backend.py:4010: calling dropout (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) with keep_prob is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `rate` instead of `keep_prob`. Rate should be set to `rate = 1 - keep_prob`.
